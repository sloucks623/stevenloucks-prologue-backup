## Lab 1.0 â€“ SOC Automation Home Lab

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**:  
To simulate and explore the Tier 1 SOC Analyst role using freely available tools, with an emphasis on *automating routine alert triage and threat investigation workflows*.

ðŸ”§ **Tools Used**:
- Splunk (Free edition)
- VirusTotal
- AbuseIPDB
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator
- Any.run sandbox
- Custom scripts and workflows to streamline common tasks

ðŸ“š **Overview**:  
This lab recreates the investigative flow a SOC analyst follows when responding to potential security alerts. The emphasis is on *learning by doing* while also identifying opportunities for **automation** in tasks like IOC lookups, reputation checking, and documentation formatting.

The project is based on guidance from the video by **My Fdir**:

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
This is an evolving lab. As automation scripts and new tools are integrated, updates will be pushed to this repository. Future versions may include Python scripting, SIEM log parsing automation, and enrichment integrations with APIs like VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB.
